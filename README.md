# Convolutional material decomposition

##

This is the training code and dataset of the three experiments carried out in our article *Robust Multi-material Decomposition of Spectral CT Using Convolutional Neural Networks*.

Code is compatible with **Python 2.7**.

##

The deep learning pack Keras 2.0.3 with Theano 0.9.0 as backend is imported in the code.
